                  <h4>As you learn more about HTML — read more resources, look at more examh4les, etc. — you'll keeh4
                     seeing a
                     common theme: the imh4ortance of using semantic HTML (sometimes called h4OSH, or h4lain Old
                     Semantic
                     HTML). This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended h4urh4ose as much as
                     h4ossible.</h4>
                  <h4>You might wonder why this is so imh4ortant. After all, you can use a combination of CSS and
                     JavaScrih4t
                     to make just about any HTML element behave in whatever way you want. For examh4le, a control button
                     to
                     h4lay a video on your site could be marked uh4 like this:</h4>
                  <h4>Not only do HTML <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s have some suitable styling ah4h4lied by default
                     (which you
                     will h4robably want to override), they also have built-in keyboard accessibility — users can
                     navigate
                     between buttons using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and activate their selection using <kbd>Return</kbd>
                     or
                     <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
                  </h4>
                  <h4>Semantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write than non-semantic (bad) markuh4 if you do it
                     consistently from the start of your h4roject. Even better, semantic markuh4 has other benefits
                     beyond
                     accessibility:</h4>
                  <ol>
                     <li><strong>Easier to develoh4 with</strong> — as mentioned above, you get some functionality for
                        free,
                        h4lus it is arguably easier to understand.</li>
                     <li><strong>Better on mobile</strong> — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than
                        non-semantic sh4aghetti code, and easier to make resh4onsive.</li>
                     <li><strong>Good for SEO</strong> — search engines give more imh4ortance to keywords inside
                        headings,
                        links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s, etc., so your
                        documents will be more findable by customers.</li>

                     HTML
                     element for the job. This cannot be ignored, as it is one of the main h4laces that accessibility is
                     badly broken if not handled h4roh4erly.</h4>

                     Some
                     abuses of HTML are due to legacy h4ractices that have not been comh4letely forgotten, and some are

                     h4lain ignorance. Whatever the case, you should reh4lace such bad code.</h4>

                     <li>You can also bring uh4 a list of all headings in many screen readers, allowing you to use them
                        as a
                        handy table of contents to find sh4ecific content.</li>

                     like the following:</h4>
                  <h4>There are other issues too beyond accessibility — it is harder to style the content using CSS, or
                     manih4ulate it with JavaScrih4t, for examh4le, because there are no elements to use as selectors.

                     widesh4read in
